 ## About this project.
    This notebook contains my analysis of the famous Palmer Penguins Data Set.
    It was a project set for my first Module in Data Analytics for ATU.

    The dataset was sourced from

## Use of this project.
    This project is useful because it utilizes the methods needed to give analysis on data, through code and images of graphs.

## Getting started.
    The user will need to have Jupyter Notebook Editor for Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) in order to clone the repository.
     The code used is python, so Annaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download) is my recomendation as it has so many bulit in functions such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy. 
     These Libraries were the first thing I imported as they are most useful for storing, visualy showing and carring out mathimatical operations.

     "pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language."
     (https://pandas.pydata.org/)

     "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible."
    (https://matplotlib.org/)

    "Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today."
    (https://numpy.org/)

## Getting help.
    If there is an issue or a query please dont hesitate to submit an issue on git hub.

## Author
    I study at [ATU] (https://www.atu.ie/). I am a mature student returning to education. I have a Bachelors of Business Studies from the former Institute of Technology Sligo - now part of ATU. I find this an interesting subject and hope to continue learning online from the beautiful north west of Ireland. I will be looking for work in the near future and at this moment I will leave my contact as my University Email.
